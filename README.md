# WanderEase

WanderEase is a web application that taps into the capabilities of the OpenTripMap API, providing individuals with a tailored adventure planning experience. Users can specify their preferred city, interests, and search radius, resulting in the dynamic creation of a grid showcasing destinations complete with engaging images and detailed descriptions. This intuitive experience is facilitated through the integration of JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap, OpenTripMap API, OpenWeatherMap API and Flight data API.
